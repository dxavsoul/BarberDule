"BarberDule is a robust Flutter application built for barbershops and individual barbers, leveraging Firebase for backend services and the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for a clean and maintainable architecture. Initially developed with Cursor, the codebase was refactored to BLoC to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary code generation. This intuitive platform revolutionizes appointment scheduling and management, seamlessly connecting barbers with their clients and streamlining the booking process for an enhanced overall barbershop experience."
